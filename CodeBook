Data is taken from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

Actual data files taken from:

Columns of Data Set:
"subject": A number that describes a subject - taken from the 'train/subject_train.txt' and 'test/subject_test.txt' files - there is one subject for each observation (row) in the train and test data sets and this was implicitly cbinded into a data.frame with the test data

"activity": The text description of the Activity from the file activity_labels.txt corresponding to the number associated in the y data set

The following are all averages of mean and standard deviation columns for each Subject and Activity in the measurements described in the HAR archive in the link above. features_info.txt describes them a bit more.
Data is aggregated by Subject and Activity and an average is taken of that aggregation.  So there is one observation row for each subject for each activity.  X, Y and Z are the directions of the movements.  Data is sampled as described in
